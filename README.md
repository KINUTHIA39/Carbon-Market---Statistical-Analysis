# Carbon Allowances in European Countries.

This is a project that uses statistical analysis to identify any mispricings in European Union Carbon Allowance futures contracts for the year 2023 - 2024.
The comparison is between the spot market, which is represented by the primary auction market that takes place at the European Energy Exchange and the secondary market represented by the Futures market which predominantly takes place at ICE.
## Regulatory Context: The Shift to Net Zero
This project prioritizes Carbon Allowances over Carbon Credits. Under the evolving EU ETS framework, allowances are a mandatory compliance tool for high-emitting industries. As the EU accelerates toward its 2030 and 2050 climate targets, the scarcity of these allowances (the "Cap") makes the relationship between Spot and Futures prices a critical indicator for both corporate hedgers and institutional investors.
