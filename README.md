# Carbon Allowances in European Countries.

This is a project that uses statistical analysis to identify any mispricings in European Union Carbon Allowance futures contracts for the year 2023 - 2024.
The comparison is between the spot market, which is represented by the primary auction market that takes place at the European Energy Exchange and the secondary market represented by the Futures market which predominantly takes place at ICE.
The choice of looking at carbon allowances as opposed to carbon credits is because as per the new EU ETS resolution for Net Zero, companies and governments will be required to adopt this new framework. Net Zero 2050 roadmap
